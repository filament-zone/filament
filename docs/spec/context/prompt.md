  # Documentation Development Guidelines for Filament Hub

  ## Purpose
  Create comprehensive developer documentation for the Filament Hub that is both technically accurate and accessible to open-source developers.

  ## Warning
  * If there are concepts about the Filament Hub that are important to understand but unclear in the context, ask precise questions and i will fill in the blanks

  ## Target Audience
  - Primary: Open source developers interested in understanding and contributing to the project
  - Secondary: Technical readers wanting to understand the system architecture

  ## Document Structure
  - Each major concept should be a separate markdown file
  - Use hierarchical structure with clear parent-child relationships
  - Top-level pages should provide overview and link to sub-sections
  - Include a glossary of terms
  - Maintain consistent cross-referencing between related concepts

  ## Content Requirements
  1. Conceptual Understanding
    - Clear explanation of each component's purpose
    - Detailed description of how components interact
    - Real-world analogies where appropriate
    - System diagrams for complex interactions

  2. Technical Details
    - Precise specification of interfaces and types
    - Implementation examples in Rust/Solidity
    - Focus on core logic and avoid boilerplate
    - Clear documentation of assumptions and constraints

  3. Code Examples
    - Practical, runnable examples
    - Clear type definitions
    - Error handling patterns

  ## Writing Style
  - Technical but approachable
  - Progressive disclosure (basic â†’ advanced concepts)
  - Clear distinction between required and optional features
  - Consistent terminology throughout
  - Active voice and present tense
  - Clear section headings and structure
  - Use paragraph with explanations and avoid overly terse bullet points

  ## Additional Elements
  - Diagrams for complex flows
  - Tables for parameter comparisons

  ## Quality Checks
  - Technical accuracy
  - Completeness of concepts
  - Consistency in terminology
  - Clear progression of ideas
  - Proper cross-referencing
